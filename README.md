# Galaxy Art Project
This is a Mathematica project to display our neighboring galaxies from the the Sloan Digital Sky Survey in a creative way. Only data from a single spatial octant was used, such that we are positioned in the corner of the data. The galaxy nodes are shown growing in size with their distance from the origin to mimic the expanding universe.
